## What is Dice-N-Die?
Dice-N-Die is a beautiful, simple, and fully responsive React web app used to roll dice for RPG style games. Users are able to roll combinations of 9 different value dice, as well as having the freedom to add and subtract static values to their roll. An ordered roll history for a given session can also be easily accessed in a seperate "tab" for reference.
